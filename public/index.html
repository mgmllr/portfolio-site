				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>A year ago I fell in love with code. Though my previous career took me through many different fields and amazing opportunities — studying film and English literature at Princeton, working as a journalist in Vietnam, interviewing the world's most influential thought leaders at Big Think, and helping to start the luxury men's apparel website Liftluxe — I always felt there was something missing. Last year, almost by chance, I discovered that that missing puzzle piece was web development. I am currently a software engineer at General Assembly, where I work with an amazing team that reshapes lives and empowers people to become the creators they always wanted to be. I live in Brooklyn, and I never turn down an opportunity to karaoke.</p>

						<p>#Win NYFW was an app I built with @ag_dubs and @modality, which won the 1st Place Singly Prize at the 2013 Hearst Fashion Hack. Like an event-based Klout, it was conceived as a way to gamify NY Fashion Week using a leaderboard based on our algorithm to measure users' social influence.</p>
